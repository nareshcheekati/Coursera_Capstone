If I build an accurate predictive model this would help to provide warning and cautions to passengers upfront, which would help to reduce the impact and sevrity of road accidents. The various benificieries and users of this model are Passengers, road traffic departments, goverment organisations, and transportation departments.\n"

The labeled column \"Severity\" is the target variable which is classified from 0 to 4 with following descriptions. 0 - Little to no Probability, 1 - Very Low Probability - Chance or Property Damage, 2 - Low Probability - Chance of Injury, 3 - Mild Probability - Chance of Serious Injury, 4 - High Probability - Chance of Fatality.\n",
