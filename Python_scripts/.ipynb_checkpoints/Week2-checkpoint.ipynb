    "Going into the details of the project, The problem I will try to solve here is to predict the severity of an accident based on the availble weather and road conditions by using historic collision data available from seattle government website.\n",

    "This problem is a global issue and as I said earlier, it is impacting so many lives on daily basis. If I build an accurate predictive model this would help to provide warning and cautions to passengers upfront, which would help to reduce the impact and sevrity of road accidents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Target Audience: The various benificieries and users of this model are Passengers, road traffic departments, goverment organisations, and transportation departments. First of all it helps passengers to stay safe and stay out of danger, next It reduces costs  and use of resources for traffic control departments due to traffic jams caused by severe accidents. In addition to that it makes good impression on government if the road accidents and the severity of accidents comes down to lower number. Finally it also helps transportation departments to build better roads to reduce accident severity.\n"

The remaining columns have different types of attributes. Some or all can be used to train the model. The labeled column \"Severity\" is the target variable which is classified from 0 to 4 with following descriptions. 0 - Little to no Probability, 1 - Very Low Probability - Chance or Property Damage, 2 - Low Probability - Chance of Injury, 3 - Mild Probability - Chance of Serious Injury, 4 - High Probability - Chance of Fatality.\n",
